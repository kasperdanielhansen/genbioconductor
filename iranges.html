<h1><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Why you should care</h1>
<p>IRanges and GRanges are data structures I use often to solve a variety of problems, typically related to annotating the genome.</p>
<p>These data structures are very fast and efficient.</p>
<p>Every R user who deals with genomic data should master these packages.</p>
<p><em>These two packages are themselves compelling arguments for learning R!</em></p>
</div>
<div id="aims" class="section level1">
<h1><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Aims</h1>
<p>We provide an overview of the two packages <code>IRanges</code> and <code>GenomicRanges</code>.</p>
<p>At first, these two packages can appear daunting, with many classes and functions. Luckily, things are not as hard as the first appear.</p>
<p>Both packages now contain very extensive and useful vignettes. Read them!</p>
</div>
<div id="idea" class="section level1">
<h1><span class="header-section-number">3</span> Idea</h1>
<p>A surprising amount of objects/tasks in computational biology can be formulated in terms of integer intervals, manipulation of integer intervals and overlap of integer intervals.</p>
<p><em>Objects</em>: A transcript (a union of integer intervals), a collection of SNPs (intervals of width 1), TF binding sites, a collection of aligned short reads.</p>
<p><em>Tasks</em>: Which TF binding sites hit the promoter of genes (overlap between two sets of intervals), which SNPs hit a collection of exons, which short reads hit a predetermined set of exons.</p>
<p><code>IRanges</code> are collections of integer intervals. <code>GRanges</code> are like <code>IRanges</code>, but with an associated chromosome and strand, taking care of some book keeping.</p>
</div>
<div id="basic-iranges" class="section level1">
<h1><span class="header-section-number">4</span> Basic IRanges</h1>
<p>Specify IRanges by 2 of start, end, width (SEW).</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(IRanges)
ir1 &lt;- IRanges(start = c(1,3,5), end = c(3,5,7))

<p>Assessor methods: <code>start()</code>, <code>end()</code>, <code>width()</code> and also replacement methods</p>

<pre><code>## IRanges of length 1

</div>
<div id="aside-granges" class="section level1">
<h1><span class="header-section-number">5</span> Aside: GRanges</h1>
<p>GRanges are like IRanges but with a strand and a chromosome (seqnames)</p>
<pre class="r"><code>gr &lt;- GRanges(seqnames = &quot;chr1&quot;, ranges = ir1,
              strand = c(&quot;+&quot;, &quot;-&quot;, &quot;+&quot;))
gr</code></pre>
<pre><code>## GRanges object with 3 ranges and 0 metadata columns:
##      seqnames    ranges strand
##         &lt;Rle&gt; &lt;IRanges&gt;  &lt;Rle&gt;
##   A1     chr1    [1, 3]      +
##   A2     chr1    [3, 5]      -
##   A3     chr1    [5, 7]      +
##   -------
##   seqinfo: 1 sequence from an unspecified genome; no seqlengths</code></pre>
<p>There are some additional differences; we will return to GRanges later.</p>

<h1><span class="header-section-number">6</span> Normal IRanges</h1>
<p>A normal IRanges is a minimal representation of the IRanges viewed as a set. Each integer only occur in a single range and there are as few ranges as possible. In addition, it is ordered. Created by reduce().</p>

<div id="manipulating-iranges" class="section level1">

<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><code>shift()</code>, <code>narrow()</code>, <code>flank()</code>, <code>shift()</code>, <code>narrow()</code>, <code>restrict()</code></li>
<li><code>union()</code>, <code>intersect()</code>, <code>setdiff()</code>, <code>gaps()</code> (returns normalized IRanges)</li>
<li><code>punion()</code>, <code>pintersect()</code>, <code>psetdiff()</code>, <code>pgap()</code></li>
</ol>
<p>Operators in 2. considers IRanges as sets of integers. Operators in 3., like <code>pmax()</code> from base R, compares the first range in two different IRanges to each other.</p>
</div>
<div id="finding-overlaps" class="section level1">
<h1><span class="header-section-number">9</span> Finding Overlaps</h1>
<p>Finding (pairwise) overlaps between two IRanges is done by <code>findOverlaps()</code>. This function is very important and amazingly fast!</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ir1 &lt;- IRanges(start = c(1,4,8), end = c(3,7,10))
ir2 &lt;- IRanges(start = c(3,4), width = 3)
ov &lt;- findOverlaps(ir1, ir2)

##   -------
##   queryLength: 3
##   subjectLength: 2</code></pre>
<p>It returns a <code>Hits</code> object which is basically a sparse matrix index. The two columns of the hits object can be accessed by <code>queryHits()</code> and <code>subjectHits()</code> (often used with <code>unique()</code>).</p>
</div>
<div id="findoverlaps-arguments" class="section level1">
<h1><span class="header-section-number">10</span> findOverlaps, arguments</h1>
<p>The list of arguments to <code>findOverlaps()</code> is long and takes a while to master. For example, you can ask to only get an overlap if two ranges overlap by a certain number of bases.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>args(findOverlaps)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## function (query, subject, maxgap = 0L, minoverlap = 1L, type = c(&quot;any&quot;,

</div>
<div id="countoverlaps" class="section level1">
<h1><span class="header-section-number">11</span> countOverlaps</h1>

<p>An IRangesList is simply a list of IRanges.</p>
<p>Why a separate class for this?</p>
<ul>
<li>Methods dispatching, ’we know what we get;.</li>
<li>Easy to specify input and output.</li>
</ul>
<p>Many XXList exists.</p>
<p>One biology use case: the set of transcripts of a gene. Each transcript is an IRanges (each exon is a range), but we need something to glue the transcripts together.</p>

<p>Rle are ‘run-length encoded’ vectors, which are very useful for representing coverage vectors efficiently.</p>
