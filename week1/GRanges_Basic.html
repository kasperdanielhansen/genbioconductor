<p><code>GRanges</code> are like <code>IRanges</code> with strand and chromosome. Strand can be <code>+</code>, <code>-</code> and <code>*</code>. The value <code>*</code> indicates ‘unknown strand’ or ‘unstranded’. This value usually gets treated as a third strand, which is sometimes confusing to users (examples below).</p>
<p>They get created with the <code>GRanges</code> constructor:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>gr &lt;- GRanges(seqnames = &quot;chr1&quot;, strand = c(&quot;+&quot;, &quot;-&quot;, &quot;+&quot;),
              ranges = IRanges(start = c(1,3,5), width = 3))</code></pre>
<p>Natural accessor functions: <code>strand()</code>, <code>seqnmes()</code>, <code>ranges()</code>, <code>start()</code>, <code>end()</code>, <code>width()</code>.</p>
<p>Because the have strand, we now have operations which are relative to the direction of transcription (<code>upstream()</code>, <code>downstream()</code>):</p>
<pre class="r"><code>flank(gr, 2, start = FALSE)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## GRanges object with 3 ranges and 0 metadata columns:

<div id="granges-seqinfo" class="section level1">
<h1><span class="header-section-number">4</span> GRanges, seqinfo</h1>
<p><code>GRanges</code> operate within a universe of sequences (chromosomes/contigs) and their lengths.</p>
<p>This is described through <code>seqinfo</code>:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>seqinfo(gr)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Seqinfo object with 1 sequence from an unspecified genome; no seqlengths:
##   seqnames seqlengths isCircular genome
##   chr1             NA         NA   &lt;NA&gt;</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>seqlengths(gr) &lt;- c(&quot;chr1&quot; = 10)
seqinfo(gr)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Seqinfo object with 1 sequence from an unspecified genome:
##   seqnames seqlengths isCircular genome
##   chr1             10         NA   &lt;NA&gt;</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>seqlevels(gr)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;chr1&quot;</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>seqlengths(gr)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## chr1 
##   10</code></pre>
<p>Especially the length of the chromosomes are used by some functions. For example <code>gaps()</code> return the stretches of the genome not covered by the <code>GRanges</code>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>gaps(gr)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## GRanges object with 5 ranges and 0 metadata columns:
##       seqnames    ranges strand
##          &lt;Rle&gt; &lt;IRanges&gt;  &lt;Rle&gt;
##   [1]     chr1   [4,  4]      +
##   [2]     chr1   [8, 10]      +
##   [3]     chr1   [1,  2]      -
##   [4]     chr1   [6, 10]      -
##   [5]     chr1   [1, 10]      *
##   -------
##   seqinfo: 1 sequence from an unspecified genome</code></pre>
<p>In this example, we know that the last gap stops at 10, because that is the length of the chromosome. Note how a range on the <code>*</code> strand appears in the result.</p>
<p>Let us expand the <code>GRanges</code> with another chromosome</p>
<pre class="r"><code>gr2 &lt;- GRanges(seqnames = c(&quot;chr1&quot;, &quot;chr2&quot;, &quot;chr1&quot;), strand = &quot;*&quot;,

##   -------

<pre class="r"><code>sort(gr2)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## GRanges object with 3 ranges and 0 metadata columns:

##   [3]     chr2    [3, 5]      *
##   -------
##   seqinfo: 2 sequences from an unspecified genome; no seqlengths</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>seqlevels(gr2)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;chr1&quot; &quot;chr2&quot;</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>seqlevels(gr2) &lt;- c(&quot;chr2&quot;, &quot;chr1&quot;)
sort(gr2)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## GRanges object with 3 ranges and 0 metadata columns:
##       seqnames    ranges strand
##          &lt;Rle&gt; &lt;IRanges&gt;  &lt;Rle&gt;
##   [1]     chr2    [3, 5]      *

##   [3]     chr1    [5, 7]      *
##   -------
##   seqinfo: 2 sequences from an unspecified genome; no seqlengths</code></pre>
<p>Note how the order of <code>seqlevels</code> affects how the <code>GRanges</code> is sorted.</p>
<p>An easy way to drop chromosomes is by</p>
<pre class="r"><code>seqlevels(gr2, force = TRUE) &lt;- &quot;chr1&quot;
gr2</code></pre>
<pre><code>## GRanges object with 2 ranges and 0 metadata columns:
##       seqnames    ranges strand
##          &lt;Rle&gt; &lt;IRanges&gt;  &lt;Rle&gt;
##   [1]     chr1    [1, 3]      *
##   [2]     chr1    [5, 7]      *
##   -------
##   seqinfo: 1 sequence from an unspecified genome; no seqlengths</code></pre>
<p>There is also <code>dropSeqlevels()</code>, <code>keepSeqlevels()</code>, <code>keepStandardChromosomes</code>.</p>
<p>Finally, you can put a <code>genome()</code> on the differenct sequences, like</p>
<pre class="r"><code>genome(gr) &lt;- &quot;hg19&quot;
genome(gr2) &lt;- &quot;hg18&quot;</code></pre>
<p>This becomes valuable when you deal with data from different genome versions (as we all do), because it allows R to throw an error, like</p>
<pre class="r"><code>findOverlaps(gr, gr2)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Error in mergeNamedAtomicVectors(genome(x), genome(y), what = c(&quot;sequence&quot;, : sequence chr1 has incompatible genomes:
##   - in 'x': hg19
##   - in 'y': hg18</code></pre>
<p>The fact that each sequence may have its own genome is more esoteric. One usecase is for experiments where the experimenter have spiked in sequences exogenous to the original organism.</p>
<p>Lets clean up <code>gr2</code> because we use it below</p>
<pre class="r"><code>genome(gr2) &lt;- &quot;hg19&quot;</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="granges-seqinfo-and-genomeinfodb" class="section level1">
<h1><span class="header-section-number">5</span> GRanges, seqinfo and genomeInfoDb</h1>
<p>Some things gets tiring, like</p>
<ul>
<li>Adding <code>seqlengths</code> to your <code>GRanges</code></li>
<li>Dealing with the fact that different annotation resources uses different naming conventions for chromosomes (like <code>chrM</code> vs <code>chrMT</code>).</li>
</ul>
<p>This is one reason the <code>GenomeInfoDb</code> package was created. It contains information about the “standard” chromosomes from widely used organisms.</p>
<p>FIXME: add section on GenomeInfoDb</p>
</div>
<div id="granges-metadata" class="section level1">
<h1><span class="header-section-number">6</span> GRanges, metadata</h1>
<p><code>GRanges</code> (unlike <code>IRanges</code>) may have associated metadata. This is immensely useful. The formal way to access and set this metadata is through <code>values</code> or <code>elementMetadata</code> or <code>mcols</code>, like</p>
<pre class="r"><code>values(gr) &lt;- DataFrame(score = c(0.1, 0.5, 0.3))
gr</code></pre>
<pre><code>## GRanges object with 3 ranges and 1 metadata column:
##       seqnames    ranges strand |     score

<h1><span class="header-section-number">7</span> DataFrame</h1>
<p>The <em><a href="http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/S4Vectors.html">S4Vectors</a></em> package introduced the <code>DataFrame</code> class. This class is very similar to the base <code>data.frame</code> class from R, but it allows columns of any class, provided a number of required methods are supported. For example, <code>DataFrame</code> can have <code>IRanges</code> as columns, unlike <code>data.frame</code>:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ir &lt;- IRanges(start = 1:2, width = 3)
df1 &lt;- DataFrame(iranges = ir)
df1</code></pre>
<pre><code>## DataFrame with 2 rows and 1 column
##     iranges
##   &lt;IRanges&gt;
## 1    [1, 3]
## 2    [2, 4]</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>df1$iranges</code></pre>
<pre><code>## IRanges of length 2
##     start end width
## [1]     1   3     3
## [2]     2   4     3</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>df2 &lt;- data.frame(iranges = ir)
df2</code></pre>
<pre><code>##   iranges.start iranges.end iranges.width
## 1             1           3             3
## 2             2           4             3</code></pre>
<p>In the <code>data.frame</code> case, the <code>IRanges</code> gives rise to 4 columns, whereas it is a single column when a <code>DataFrame</code> is used.</p>
<p>Think of this as an expanded and more versatile class.</p>
</div>
<div id="findoverlaps" class="section level1">
<h1><span class="header-section-number">8</span> findOverlaps</h1>
<p><code>findOverlaps</code> works exactly as for <code>IRanges</code>. But the <code>strand</code> information can be confusing. Let us make an example</p>
<pre class="r"><code>gr</code></pre>
<pre><code>## GRanges object with 3 ranges and 2 metadata columns:
##       seqnames    ranges strand |     score    score2
##          &lt;Rle&gt; &lt;IRanges&gt;  &lt;Rle&gt; | &lt;numeric&gt; &lt;numeric&gt;
##   [1]     chr1    [1, 3]      + |       0.1      0.02
##   [2]     chr1    [3, 5]      - |       0.5       0.1
##   [3]     chr1    [5, 7]      + |       0.3      0.06
##   -------
##   seqinfo: 1 sequence from hg19 genome</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>gr2</code></pre>
<pre><code>## GRanges object with 2 ranges and 0 metadata columns:
##       seqnames    ranges strand
##          &lt;Rle&gt; &lt;IRanges&gt;  &lt;Rle&gt;
##   [1]     chr1    [1, 3]      *
##   [2]     chr1    [5, 7]      *
##   -------
##   seqinfo: 1 sequence from hg19 genome; no seqlengths</code></pre>
<p>Note how the <code>ranges</code> in the two <code>GRanges</code> object are the same coordinates, they just have different <code>seqnames</code> and <code>strand</code>. Let us try to do a standard <code>findOverlaps</code>:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>findOverlaps(gr, gr2)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Hits object with 4 hits and 0 metadata columns:
##       queryHits subjectHits
##       &lt;integer&gt;   &lt;integer&gt;
##   [1]         1           1
##   [2]         2           1
##   [3]         2           2
##   [4]         3           2
##   -------
##   queryLength: 3
##   subjectLength: 2</code></pre>
<p>FIXME: this section is wrong</p>
<p>Notice how the first element of <code>gr</code> does not overlap with the first element of <code>gr2</code>. This is because by default a strand of <code>*</code> does not overlap a strand of <code>+</code>. This might be confusing. One way of fixing this is by using the <code>ignore.strand</code> argument to <code>findOverlaps</code>:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>findOverlaps(gr, gr2, ignore.strand = TRUE)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Hits object with 4 hits and 0 metadata columns:
##       queryHits subjectHits
##       &lt;integer&gt;   &lt;integer&gt;
##   [1]         1           1
##   [2]         2           1
##   [3]         2           2
##   [4]         3           2
##   -------
##   queryLength: 3
##   subjectLength: 2</code></pre>
<p>Several other functions in <code>GenomicRanges</code> have an <code>ignore.strand</code> argument for this reason.</p>
