<h1><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Overview</h1>
<p>Annotation information is extremely important for putting your data into context. There are many online resources for doing this, and many different databases organizes different information suing different approaches.</p>
<p>There are multiple ways to access annotation information in Bioconductor.</p>
<p>Here we discuss a new way of doing so, through the package <em><a href="http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/AnnotationHub.html">AnnotationHub</a></em>. This package provides access to a ton of online resources through a unified interface. However, each data resource has its own peculiarities, so a user still needs to understand what the different datasets are.</p>
<p>In a recent paper I was involved in <span class="citation">(Hansen et al. 2014)</span>, I used <em><a href="http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/AnnotationHub.html">AnnotationHub</a></em> to interrogate my data against all transcription factor data available through the ENCODE project. I managed to write the code and conduct the analysis in the matter of a single evening, which I think is pretty awesome.</p>

<div id="other-resources" class="section level1">

<p>First we create an <code>AnnotationHub</code> instance. The first time you do this, it will create a local cache on your system, so that repeat queries for the same information (even in different R sessions) will be very fast.</p>

<p>As you can see, <code>ah</code> contains tons of information. The information content is constantly changing, which is why there is a <code>snapshotDate</code>. While the object is big, it actually only contains pointers to online information. Actually downloading all the resources available in an <code>AnnotationHub</code> is prohibitive.</p>
<p>The object is organized as a vector, with single-dimension indexing. You can get information about a single resource by indexing with a single <code>[</code>; using two brackets (<code>[[</code>) downloads the object:</p>

<p>The way you use <em><a href="http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/AnnotationHub.html">AnnotationHub</a></em> is by using various tools to narrow down your hub to a single or a small number of datasets. Then you download these datasets for your own usage.</p>
<p>Let us first explore some high-level features of the hub:</p>

<p>(we will discuss many of these data classes in future sessions).</p>
<p>You can narrow down the hub by using one (or more) of the following strategies</p>
<ul>
<li>Use <code>subset</code> (or <code>[</code>) to do a specific subsetting operation.</li>
<li>Use <code>query</code> to do a command-line search over the metadata of the hub.</li>
<li>Use <code>display</code> to get a Shiny interface in a browser, so you can browse the object.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is often useful to start with a very rough subsetting, for example to data from a specific species. The <code>subset</code> function is useful for doing a standard R subsetting (the function also works on <code>data.frame</code>s).</p>

<p>We can use <code>query</code> to search the hub. The (possible) drawback to query is that it searches over different fields in the hub, so watch out with using a search term which is very non-specific. The query is a regular expression, which by default is case-insensitive. Here we locate all datasets on the <strong>H3K4me3</strong> histone modification (in H. sapiens because we selected this species above)</p>
